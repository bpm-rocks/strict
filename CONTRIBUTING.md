Contributing
============

Here's a quick list of tips for contributing to this project:

1. We follow the Tests Always Included [Style Guide].
2. Tests should support any additional functionality.
3. You should make sure your editor uses [EditorConfig] so you can follow our whitespace rules easily. This is optional, but a convenient way to configure your editor to match our style.
4. Since this is Bash, please lint with [ShellCheck].

Thanks for helping out!
